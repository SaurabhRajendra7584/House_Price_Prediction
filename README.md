# 🏠 House Price Prediction App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts housing prices using the XGBoost regression algorithm. Built with Streamlit for interactive user experience and trained on real-world housing data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This app allows users to input key housing features (e.g., area, quality, year built, number of rooms) and returns an estimated sale price based on a highly accurate trained XGBoost model.

* **Model Accuracy:** R² = 0.9146
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** ₹25,596.15
* **Frameworks Used:** XGBoost, scikit-learn, Streamlit, pandas, seaborn
